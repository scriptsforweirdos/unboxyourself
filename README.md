# Unbox Yourself!

This is an Android app. It's my first Android app, in fact. 

## Great! So what does it do?

Unbox Yourself is designed for extreme introverts like myself who may not leave the house for many days or weeks in a row. It allows us to track our adventures into the great outdoors in a quiet and non-disruptive way. 

You can track your outings automatically via GPS or Wifi Signal, or manually by pressing a button.

Archived outings are stored in a SQLite database on internal storage and can be exported in CSV format to your external storage card.

## License & Privacy

Unbox Yourself doesn't "phone home" to any remote server. It's very explicit about the fact that it's running. I wouldn't recommend trying to install it on anyone else's phone but your own.

Unbox Yourself contains no ads. I would really prefer that any children of this code also remain ad-free. 

This is pre-pre-pre-not-even-cuneiform-alpha, so use at your own risk.

## About the Scripts for Weirdos project

I have been creating web apps since 1999, but have never had a public portfolio of code. I decided to start Scripts for Weirdos after seeing progress made by a photographer friend of mine by posting one new portfolio photo a day to Facebook over the course of a year.
Much like her photography project, with SFW I will be learning a new lang and writing an app in it each week for a year.

## About the Development of this Project

With this first project I immediately moved the goalposts and wound up taking 2.5 weeks. I suppose I can claim the excuse that this didn't really involve learning one single lang. I had to learn Java, SQLite, Google's version of XML and how to use the Android Studio IDE. I think all told I did pretty well.

I came into this project with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 running rooted Kitkat, and about 14 years in the LAMP stack.

An installable APK of Unbox Yourself is now available for download at http://kaycleaves.com/unbox-yourself.
